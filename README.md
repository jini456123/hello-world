# hello-world
I am a student, currently self-teaching machine learning and data science. Previously, I've completed a course on Machine Learning/Deep Learning on Udemy. I've worked on a personal project as a hands-on practice on sentiment analysis using recurrent neural network, Naive Bayes methods, etc. I feel that that is where I am mostly interested at this moment, although I want to get into computer vision as well. After taking some courses to prep for the Data Science Immersive program and talking to people about career in data science, I felt the need to start utilizing Github. Other than that, I feel that I am competent in my coding fundamentals. 

I love the concept of building your own neural networks (like the brain), which led me to creating jungsNN (Jung's Neural Network).
